# City Records
This repo holds a collection of utilities to fetch documents from a document repository and upload them incrementally to Google Drive, optionally performing ocr and FTS indexing. Currently only the City of Berkeley is supported, via the public access records portal: https://records.cityofberkeley.info/PublicAccess/paFiles/cqFiles/index.html
